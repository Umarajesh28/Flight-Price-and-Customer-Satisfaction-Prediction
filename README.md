# Flight Price and Customer Satisfaction Prediction
## Overview
This project consists of two interconnected machine learning applications aimed at enhancing the travel and tourism domain:
1.	Flight Price Prediction (Regression)
2.	Customer Satisfaction Prediction (Classification)
Both applications are integrated into a single Streamlit app with separate pages for each project. Additionally, MLflow is used for model tracking and management.

# Project 1: Flight Price Prediction (Regression)
### Objective
Develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict flight ticket prices based on factors such as departure time, source, destination, and airline type. Deploy the pipeline in an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
### Skills Utilized
•	Python
•	Machine Learning
•	Data Analysis
•	Streamlit
•	MLflow
### Methodology
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
•	Handle missing values and duplicates.
•	Convert date/time columns into standard formats.
•	Engineer new features (e.g., Duration_Hours, Duration_Minutes).
#### 2. Model Development
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
•	Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc).
•	Log experiments, parameters, and metrics using MLflow.
#### 3. Streamlit App Development
•	Visualize trends in flight prices.
•	Enable user input for route, airline, and date/time to predict prices.

### Skills Utilized
•	Python
•	Machine Learning
•	Data Analysis
•	Streamlit
•	MLflow
### Methodology
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
•	Handle missing values and duplicates.
•	Encode categorical features.
•	Normalize numerical features.
#### 2. Model Development
•	Perform EDA to understand feature relationships.
•	Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.,).
•	Log experiments, metrics (accuracy, F1-score), and confusion matrices using MLflow.
#### 3. Streamlit App Development
•	Visualize customer satisfaction trends.
•	Allow user input for features to predict satisfaction levels.
